## 📄 Abstract
Early and accurate detection of lemon disease is necessary for effective citrus crop management. This repository provides code and resources for our proposed Adaptive PSO-LemonNetX, a hybrid framework that combines:
- Deep Learning–based image classification (LemonNetX)
- Adaptive Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for feature selection
- Explainable AI (XAI) with LIME

Our model achieves:
- 97.01% testing accuracy
- 98.55% validation accuracy
- Up to 100% validation accuracy with Naive Bayes
